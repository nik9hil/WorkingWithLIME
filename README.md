# WorkingWithLIME
The project was done under Institute for Medicine and Allied Sciences(INMAS), a lab under DRDO, during Winter 2018. The aim was to understand on what basis, a classifier model was assigning a particuar label to a given image. There were three classes:
1. Soldier
2. Civilian
3. Weapon (Primarily guns/rifles)

The dataset was majorly handmade.
Future prospects include using better techniques like Shapley method.
